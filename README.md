All images are monochrome values.

HW 2: 
- Compute the mean and variance of image arrays.

HW 3: 
- Convert image into a binary image using a threshold value found from a histogram. 
- Find the center of the shape by taking the average coordinates of the edge points

HW 4:
- Apply edge detection operator using 3x3 Sobel operators and computing the squared gradient for each edge point
- Convert the image to a binary image to increase contrast 

HW 5: 
- Create the squared gradient magnitude image
- Apply hough transform to detect hard edges and find the hough transform threshold

HW 7:
- Display the illuminated image of a lambertian sphere from a single light source with different illumination and source location
